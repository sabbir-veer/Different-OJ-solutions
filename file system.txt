#file system
* linux follows unix traditions that is why linux uses forward slash
instead of the back slash like windows.
* linux also cares about capitalization in file naming
directories:

/bin  (binary)

/sbin (system binary. this is for administrator usage. general users 
can't access without permission)

/boot
(this folder contains everything to boot in)

/dev
(this is where our devices live 
this folder contains every information related to disks
this is typically an area that applications and drivers will access)

/etc
(this folder stores all of our configuration like package manager, 
some log files and so on)

/lib
(libraries are files that application can use to perform various functions
they are required by bin and sbin)

/media and /mnt or mount
(all mounted devices like flash drive and other drives such D, F etc are
found here. some os manages these in dev so it can be found empty)

/opt
(opt contains all the applications we install manually like chrome)

/proc
(proc contains all the psudo files or processes running
for example: cat /proc/cpuinfo  #this will show information of cpu
cat /proc/uptime #will show the uptime of the pc)

/root
(root is root user's home directory. if we want to access or edit system
files we need root permission which is defined here)

/run
(it's run in ram and everything in it will reset when rebooted or shut down)

/srv
(service directory that stores different servers like ftp or web servers)

/sys
(system directory is for connecting with kernal, loads graphics driver and 
so on and nothing get stored here)

/tmp
(temporary directory where temporary files stores)

/home
(each user has it's own home folder and individual informations)
